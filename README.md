    -   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Dark Orange (#ca5005) and White.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. For some headers Pacifico is used.
        Poppins is modern, clean and legible, whereas Pacifico is a cursive script-type font. This was a deliberate design choice intended to reference the 'letters' part of the band's name ('Letters to Elmo'). Both are Google Fonts.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Alongside the use of hero images on the gallery and index pages, cards are employed to differentiate various content elements.
